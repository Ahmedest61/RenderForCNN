### Introduction

Our work was initially described in an [arXiv tech report](http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05641) and will appear as an ICCV 2015 paper. Render for CNN is a scalable image synthesis pipeline for generating millions of training images for high-capacity models such as deep CNNs. We demonstrated how to use this pipeline, together with specially designed network architecture, to train CNNs to learn viewpoints of objects from millions of synthetic images and real images. In this repository, we provide both the rendering pipeline codes and off-the-shelf viewpoint estimator for PASCAL3D+ objects.
